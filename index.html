  <h2>The initiative.</h2>
  <p>RemoteDebug is an initiative to bring a common remote debugging protocol to today's browsers. </p>

  <p>Today each browser vendor is building their own tailormade in-browser development tool (DevTool), together with their own protocol to enable remote debugging of browsers across devices.</p>
  <p>These protocols are incompatible, which means existing DevTools can't debug other browsers, and tooling implementers needs to put a lot of effort into adding support for each protocol, with the result that we haven't seen that many integrations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>We need to change this.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The open web follows standards. Our tools should too.</p>

  <h2>The vision.</h2>
  <p>The vision is to enable a new generation of DevTools and editors that are able to communicate with our several browsers independently of their vendor.</p>

  <p>The RemoteDebug initative was announced at <a href="http://2013.full-frontal.org/">FullFrontal 2013</a> by <a href="http://kenneth.io">Kenneth Auchenberg</a> in his "Our web development workflow is completely broken" talk.</p>

  <p>A few thoughts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browser history shows us that the dominant browser will change. Why do we keep making browser specific tools, when we know it's going to change?</li>
    <li>What if it was possible to use Chrome DevTools to debug Firefox, or use Firefox DevTools to debug Chrome?</li>
    <li>What if you could debug your app in IE and Chrome directly from Sublime Text?</li>
    <li>What if the browser had an API, you could use to extract and manipulate information to build better development tools, instead of re-creating the logic we already have?</li>
    <li>What if you could use your favorite debugging tool to debug your beautiful PhoneGap-app inside an embeded WebView?</li>
    <li>What if the browser DevTools-teams worked and innovated together instead of the current situtation?</li>
  <ul>
